# HTMLify

Host and share front-end projects and code easily

HTMLify lets users quickly host and share client-side web projects and code snippets, designed with developers in mind.

## Development

If you want to contribute to the project or set it up locally, follow these steps:

### Requirements
- Python
- Git

## Setup

1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://GitHub.com/Artizote/HTMLify.git
cd HTMLify
```

2. Run the `setup.py` script for quick setup

```

This will create required directories and install dependencies, and verify that any other dependencies are installed.

If everything goes as expected, the site would be available on `127.0.0.1:5000`
